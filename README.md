# Adaptive dynamic programming algorithms

Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), also known as approximate dynamic programming, neuro-dynamic programming, and reinforcement learning (RL), is a class of promising techniques to solve the problems of optimal control for nonlinear systems.

 MATLAB codes of fundamental ADP algorithms, including iterative and online ADP, are provided.
